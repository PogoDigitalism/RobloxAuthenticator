# Roblox Trade Authenticator

This is a simple function written for Python to combat Roblox' new **2FA MOBILE authentication** system. This is not a module or anything, I suggest you just copy paste the function and integrate it in your projects where necessary. 

You need:
 - Roblox trade ID (will probably be a dynamic variable in your code)
 - Roblox user ID (constant/variable)
 - ROBLOSECURITY cookie (for authorization)
 - Secret Key for TOTP (tutorial on how to get that inside the code)

example.py contains the source.

This function requires the pyotp and requests libraries
